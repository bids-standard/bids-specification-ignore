    "1.  **Dataset** - a set of neuroimaging and behavioral data acquired for a\n",
    "    purpose of a particular study. A dataset consists of data acquired from one\n",
    "    or more subjects, possibly from multiple sessions.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Session** - a logical grouping of neuroimaging and behavioral data\n",

    "    to a visit in a longitudinal study. In general, subjects will stay in the\n",

    "    MRI acquisitions will still be considered as a session and match sessions\n",
    "    acquired in other subjects. Similarly, in situations where different data\n",
    "    types are obtained over several visits (for example fMRI on one day followed\n",
    "    by DWI the day after) those can be grouped in one session. Defining multiple\n",
    "    sessions is appropriate when several identical or similar data acquisitions\n",
    "    are planned and performed on all -or most- subjects, often in the case of\n",
    "    some intervention between sessions (for example, training).\n",
    "    In the [PET](04-modality-specific-files/09-positron-emission-tomography.md)\n",
    "    context, a session may also indicate a group of related scans,\n",
    "    taken in one or more visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sample** - a sample pertaining to a subject such as tissue, primary cell\n",
    "    or cell-free sample.\n",
    "    The `sample-<label>` key/value pair is used to distinguish between different\n",
    "    samples from the same subject.\n",
    "    The label MUST be unique per subject and is RECOMMENDED to be unique\n",

    "    scanning sequence/protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data type** - a functional group of different types of data.\n",
    "    BIDS defines the following data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  `func` (task based and resting state functional MRI)\n",
    "    1.  `dwi` (diffusion weighted imaging)\n",
    "    1.  `fmap` (field inhomogeneity mapping data such as field maps)\n",

    "    1.  `perf` (perfusion)\n",
    "    1.  `meg` (magnetoencephalography)\n",
    "    1.  `eeg` (electroencephalography)\n",
    "    1.  `ieeg` (intracranial electroencephalography)\n",

    "    1.  `micr` (microscopy)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data files are contained in a directory named for the data type.\n",
    "    In raw datasets, the data type directory is nested inside subject and\n",
    "    (optionally) session directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Task** - a set of structured activities performed by the participant.\n",
    "    Tasks are usually accompanied by stimuli and responses, and can greatly vary\n",
    "    in complexity. For the purpose of this specification we consider the so-called\n",
    "    \"resting state\" a task. In the context of brain scanning, a task is always\n",
    "    tied to one data acquisition. Therefore, even if during one acquisition the\n",
    "    subject performed multiple conceptually different behaviors (with different\n",
    "    sets of instructions) they will be considered one (combined) task.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Event** - something that happens or may be perceived by a test subject as happening\n",
    "    at a particular instant during the recording.\n",
    "    Events are most commonly associated with on- or offset of stimulus presentations,\n",
    "    or with the distinct marker of on- or offset of a subject's response or motor action.\n",
    "    Other events may include unplanned incidents\n",
    "    (for example, sudden onset of noise and vibrations due to construction work,\n",
    "    laboratory device malfunction),\n",
    "    changes in task instructions (for example, switching the response hand),\n",
    "    or experiment control parameters (for example,\n",
    "    changing the stimulus presentation rate over experimental blocks),\n",
    "    and noted data feature occurrences (for example, a recording electrode producing noise).\n",
    "    In BIDS, each event has an onset time and duration.\n",
    "    Note that not all tasks will have recorded events (for example, \"resting state\").\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Run** - an uninterrupted repetition of data acquisition that has the same\n",
    "    acquisition parameters and task (however events can change from run to run\n",
    "    due to different subject response or randomized nature of the stimuli). Run\n",
    "    is a synonym of a data acquisition.\n",
    "    Note that \"uninterrupted\" may look different by modality due to the nature of the\n",
    "    recording.\n",
    "    For example, in [MRI](04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.md)\n",
    "    or [MEG] (04-modality-specific-files/02-magnetoencephalography.md),\n",
    "    if a subject leaves the scanner, the acquisition must be restarted.\n",
    "    For some types of [PET](04-modality-specific-files/09-positron-emission-tomography.md) acquisitions,\n",
    "    a subject may leave and re-enter the scanner without interrupting the scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Modality** - the category of brain data recorded by a file.\n",
    "    For MRI data, different pulse sequences are considered distinct modalities,\n",
    "    such as `T1w`, `bold` or `dwi`.\n",
    "    For passive recording techniques, such as EEG, MEG or iEEG,\n",
    "    the technique is sufficiently uniform to define the modalities `eeg`,\n",
    "    `meg` and `ieeg`.\n",
    "    When applicable, the modality is indicated in the **suffix**.\n",
    "    The modality may overlap with, but should not be confused with\n",
    "    the **data type**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`<index>`** - a nonnegative integer, possibly prefixed with arbitrary number of\n",
    "    0s for consistent indentation, for example, it is `01` in `run-01` following\n",
    "    `run-<index>` specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`<label>`** - an alphanumeric value, possibly prefixed with arbitrary\n",
    "    number of 0s for consistent indentation, for example, it is `rest` in `task-rest`\n",
    "    following `task-<label>` specification. Note that labels MUST not collide when\n",
    "    casing is ignored (see [Case collision intolerance](#case-collision-intolerance)).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`suffix`** - an alphanumeric value, located after the `key-value_` pairs (thus after\n",
    "    the final `_`), right before the **File extension**, for example, it is `eeg` in\n",
    "    `sub-05_task-matchingpennies_eeg.vhdr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **File extension** - a portion of the filename after the left-most\n",
    "    period (`.`) preceded by any other alphanumeric. For example, `.gitignore` does\n",
    "    not have a file extension, but the file extension of `test.nii.gz` is `.nii.gz`.\n",
    "    Note that the left-most period is included in the file extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **DEPRECATED** - A \"deprecated\" entity or metadata field SHOULD NOT be used in the\n",
    "    generation of new datasets.\n",
    "    It remains in the standard in order to preserve the interpretability of existing datasets.\n",
    "    Validating software SHOULD warn when deprecated practices are detected and provide a\n",
    "    suggestion for updating the dataset to preserve the curator's intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compulsory, optional, and additional data and metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "The following standard describes a way of arranging data and writing down\n",
    "metadata for a subset of neuroimaging experiments. Some aspects of the standard\n",
    "are compulsory. For example a particular filename format is required when\n",
    "storing structural scans. Some aspects are regulated but optional. For example a\n",
    "T2 volume does not need to be included, but when it is available it should be\n",
    "saved under a particular filename specified in the standard. This standard\n",
    "aspires to describe a majority of datasets, but acknowledges that there will be\n",
    "cases that do not fit. In such cases one can include additional files and\n",
    "subdirectories to the existing directory structure following common sense. For example\n",
    "one may want to include eye tracking data in a vendor specific format that is\n",
    "not covered by this standard. The most sensible place to put it is next to the\n",
    "continuous recording file with the same naming scheme but different extensions.\n",
    "The solutions will change from case to case and publicly available datasets will\n",
    "be reviewed to include common data types in the future releases of the BIDS\n",
    "specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File name structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A filename consists of a chain of *entities*, or key-value pairs, a *suffix* and an\n",
    "*extension*.\n",
    "Two prominent examples of entities are `subject` and `session`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a data file that was collected in a given `session` from a given\n",
    "`subject`, the filename MUST begin with the string `sub-<label>_ses-<label>`.\n",
    "If the `session` level is omitted in the directory structure, the filename MUST begin\n",
    "with the string `sub-<label>`, without `ses-<label>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `sub-<label>` corresponds to the `subject` entity because it has\n",
    "the `sub-` \"key\" and`<label>` \"value\", where `<label>` would in a real data file\n",
    "correspond to a unique identifier of that subject, such as `01`.\n",
    "The same holds for the `session` entity with its `ses-` key and its `<label>`\n",
    "value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extra session layer (at least one `/ses-<label>` subdirectory) SHOULD\n",
    "be added for all subjects if at least one subject in the dataset has more than\n",
    "one session.\n",
    "If a `/ses-<label>` subdirectory is included as part of the directory hierarchy,\n",
    "then the same [`ses-<label>`](./99-appendices/09-entities.md#ses)\n",
    "key/value pair MUST also be included as part of the filenames themselves.\n",
    "Acquisition time of session can\n",
    "be defined in the [sessions file](03-modality-agnostic-files.md#sessions-file).\n",
    "\n",
    "A chain of entities, followed by a suffix, connected by underscores (`_`)\n",
    "produces a human readable filename, such as `sub-01_task-rest_eeg.edf`.\n",
    "It is evident from the filename alone that the file contains resting state\n",
    "data from subject `01`.\n",
    "The suffix `eeg` and the extension `.edf` depend on the imaging modality and\n",
    "the data format and indicate further details of the file's contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entities within a filename MUST be unique.\n",
    "For example, the following filename is not valid because it uses the `acq`\n",
    "entity twice:\n",
    "`sub-01_acq-laser_acq-uneven_electrodes.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where entities duplicate metadata,\n",
    "the presence of an entity should not be used as a replacement for\n",
    "the corresponding metadata field.\n",
    "For instance, in echo-planar imaging MRI,\n",
    "the [`dir-<label>`](./99-appendices/09-entities.md#dir) entity MAY be used\n",
    "to distinguish files with different phase-encoding directions,\n",
    "but the file's `PhaseEncodingDirection` can only be specified as metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "A summary of all entities in BIDS and the order in which they MUST be\n",
    "specified is available in the [entity table](./99-appendices/04-entity-table.md)\n",
    "in the appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entity-linked file collections\n",
    "\n",
    "An entity-linked file collection is a set of files that are related to each other\n",
    "based on a repetitive acquisition of sequential data\n",
    "by changing acquisition parameters one (or multiple) at a time\n",
    "or by being inherent components of the same data.\n",
    "Entity-linked collections are identified by a common suffix,\n",
    "indicating the group of files that should be considered a logical unit.\n",
    "Within each collection, files MUST be distinguished from each other by at least one\n",
    "entity (for example, `echo`) that corresponds to an altered acquisition parameter\n",
    "(`EchoTime`) or that defines a component relationship (for example, `part`).\n",
    "Note that these entities MUST be described by the specification and\n",
    "the parameter changes they declare MUST NOT invalidate the definition of the accompanying suffix.\n",
    "For example, the use of the `echo` entity along with the `T1w` suffix casts doubt on\n",
    "the validity of the identified contrast weighting.\n",
    "Provided the conditions above are satisfied,\n",
    "any suffix (such as `bold`) can identify an entity-linked file collection,\n",
    "although certain suffixes are exclusive for this purpose (for example, `MP2RAGE`).\n",
    "Use cases concerning this convention are compiled in the\n",
    "[file collections](./99-appendices/10-file-collections.md) appendix.\n",
    "This convention is mainly intended for but not limited to MRI modalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case collision intolerance\n",
    "\n",
    "File name components are case sensitive,\n",
    "but collisions MUST be avoided when casing is ignored.\n",
    "For example, a dataset cannot contain both `sub-s1` and `sub-S1`,\n",
    "as the labels would collide on a case-insensitive filesystem.\n",
    "Additionally, because the suffix `eeg` is defined,\n",
    "then the suffix `EEG` will not be added to future versions of the standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Source vs. raw vs. derived data\n",
    "\n",
    "BIDS was originally designed to describe and apply consistent naming conventions\n",
    "to raw (unprocessed or minimally processed due to file format conversion) data.\n",
    "During analysis such data will be transformed and partial as well as final results\n",
    "will be saved.\n",
    "Derivatives of the raw data (other than products of DICOM to NIfTI conversion)\n",
    "MUST be kept separate from the raw data. This way one can protect the raw data\n",
    "from accidental changes by file permissions. In addition it is easy to\n",
    "distinguish partial results from the raw data and share the latter.\n",
    "See [Storage of derived datasets](#storage-of-derived-datasets) for more on\n",
    "organizing derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar rules apply to source data, which is defined as data before\n",
    "harmonization, reconstruction, and/or file format conversion (for example, E-Prime event logs or DICOM files).\n",
    "Storing actual source files with the data is preferred over links to\n",
    "external source repositories to maximize long term preservation,\n",
    "which would suffer if an external repository would not be available anymore.\n",
    "This specification currently does not go into the details of\n",
    "recommending a particular naming scheme for including different types of\n",
    "source data (such as the raw event logs or parameter files, before conversion to BIDS).\n",
    "However, in the case that these data are to be included:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  These data MUST be kept in separate `sourcedata` directory with a similar\n",
    "    directory structure as presented below for the BIDS-managed data. For example:\n",
    "    `sourcedata/sub-01/ses-pre/func/sub-01_ses-pre_task-rest_bold.dicom.tgz` or\n",
    "    `sourcedata/sub-01/ses-pre/func/MyEvent.sce`.\n",

    "    `derivatives` directory, or both.\n",
    "    This file should describe the nature of the raw data or the derived data.\n",

    "be converted to the NIfTI format using a tool that provides as much of the NIfTI\n",

    "(with the same filename as the `.nii[.gz]` file, but with a `.json` extension).\n",
    "Extraction of BIDS compatible metadata can be performed using [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix)\n",
    "and [dicm2nii](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42997-xiangruili-dicm2nii)\n",

    "### Tabular files\n",

    "written in [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) with the\n",
    "first letter in lower case (for example, `variable_name`, not `Variable_name`).\n",
    "String values containing tabs MUST be escaped using double\n",
    "quotes. Missing and non-applicable values MUST be coded as `n/a`. Numerical\n",
    "values MUST employ the dot (`.`) as decimal separator and MAY be specified\n",
    "in scientific notation, using `e` or `E` to separate the significand from the\n",
    "exponent. TSV files MUST be in UTF-8 encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Text\n",
    "onset\tduration\tresponse_time\tcorrect\tstop_trial\tgo_trial\n",
    "200\t200\t0\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\n",

    "## The Inheritance Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Any metadata file (such as `.json`, `.bvec` or `.tsv`) MAY be defined at any directory level.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  For a given data file, any metadata file is applicable to that data file if:\n",
    "    1.  It is stored at the same directory level or higher;\n",
    "    1.  The metadata and the data filenames possess the same suffix;\n",
    "    1.  The metadata filename does not include any entity absent from the data filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A metadata file MUST NOT have a filename that would be otherwise applicable\n",
    "    to some data file based on rules 2.b and 2.c but is made inapplicable based on its\n",
    "    location in the directory structure as per rule 2.a.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  There MUST NOT be multiple metadata files applicable to a data file at one level\n",
    "    of the directory hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If multiple metadata files satisfy criteria 2.a-c above:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  For [tabular files](#tabular-files) and other simple metadata files\n",
    "        (for instance, [`bvec` / `bval` files for diffusion MRI](#04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging#required-gradient-orientation-information)),\n",
    "        accessing metadata associated with a data file MUST consider only the\n",
    "        applicable file that is lowest in the filesystem hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  For [JSON files](#key-value-files-dictionaries), key-values are loaded\n",
    "        from files from the top of the directory hierarchy downwards, such that\n",
    "        key-values from the top level are inherited by all data files at lower\n",
    "        levels to which it is applicable unless overridden by a value for the\n",
    "        same key present in another metadata file at a lower level\n",
    "        (though it is RECOMMENDED to minimize the extent of such overrides).\n",
    "\n",
    "Corollaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  As per rule 3, metadata files applicable only to a specific participant / session\n",
    "    MUST be defined in or below the directory corresponding to that participant / session;\n",
    "    similarly, a metadata file that is applicable to multiple participants / sessions\n",
    "    MUST NOT be placed within a directory corresponding to only one such participant / session.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It is permissible for a single metadata file to be applicable to multiple data\n",
    "    files at that level of the hierarchy or below. Where such metadata content is consistent\n",
    "    across multiple data files, it is RECOMMENDED to store metadata in this\n",
    "    way, rather than duplicating that metadata content across multiple metadata files.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Where multiple applicable JSON files are loaded as per rule 5.b, key-values can\n",
    "    only be overwritten by files lower in the filesystem hierarchy; the absence of\n",
    "    a key-value in a later file does not imply the \"unsetting\" of that field\n",
