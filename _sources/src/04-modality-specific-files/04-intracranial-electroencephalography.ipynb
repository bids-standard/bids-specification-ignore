    "potential (voltage) difference that is stored in the iEEG dataset. We employ the\n",
    "following short definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Electrode = A single point of contact between the acquisition system and the\n",
    "    recording site (for example, scalp, neural tissue, ...). Multiple electrodes can be\n",
    "    organized as arrays, grids, leads, strips, probes, shafts, caps (for EEG),\n",
    "    and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Channel = A single analog-to-digital converter in the recording system that\n",
    "    regularly samples the value of a transducer, which results in the signal\n",
    "    being represented as a time series in the digitized data. This can be\n",
    "    connected to two electrodes (to measure the potential difference between\n",
    "    them), a magnetic field or magnetic gradient sensor, temperature sensor,\n",
    "    accelerometer, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the _reference_ and _ground_ electrodes are often referred to as\n",
    "channels, they are in most common iEEG systems not recorded by themselves.\n",
    "Therefore they are not represented as channels in the data. The type of\n",
    "referencing for all channels and optionally the location of the reference\n",
    "electrode and the location of the ground electrode MAY be specified.\n",
