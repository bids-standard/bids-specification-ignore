    "by the [Open Microscopy Environment](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/) for whole-slide imaging with\n",
    "the [OME-TIFF file specifications](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/6.1.2/ome-tiff/file-structure.html).\n",
    "The OME-TIFF file allows for multi-page TIFF files to store multiple image planes and supports\n",
    "multi-resolution pyramidal tiled images. An OME-XML data block is also embedded inside the\n",
    "fileâ€™s header.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BIDS standard accepts microscopy data in a number of file formats to accommodate datasets\n",
    "stored in 2D image formats and whole-slide imaging formats, to accommodate lossless and lossy\n",
    "compression, and to avoid unnecessary conversions of the original data from a non-tiled to a\n",
    "tiled format, or vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microscopy raw data MUST be stored in one of the following formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Portable Network Graphics](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/) (`.png`)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Tag Image File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF) (`.tif`)\n",
