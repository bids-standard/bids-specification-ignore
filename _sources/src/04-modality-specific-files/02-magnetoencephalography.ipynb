    "With the MEG specification of BIDS, we wish to promote the adoption of good\n",
    "practices in the management of scientific data.\n",
    "Hence, the emphasis is not to impose a new, generic data format for the\n",
    "modality, but rather to standardize the way data is stored in repositories.\n",
    "Further, there is currently no widely accepted standard file format for MEG, but\n",
    "major software applications, including free and open-source solutions for MEG\n",
    "data analysis, provide readers of such raw files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some software readers may skip important metadata that is specific to MEG system\n",
    "manufacturers. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that users provide additional meta\n",
    "information extracted from the manufacturer raw data files in a sidecar JSON\n",
    "file. This allows for easy searching and indexing of key metadata elements\n",
    "without the need to parse files in proprietary data format. Other relevant files\n",
    "MAY be included alongside the MEG data; examples are provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "This template is for MEG data of any kind, including but not limited to\n",
    "task-based, resting-state, and noise recordings.\n",
    "If multiple *Tasks* were performed within a single *Run*,\n",
    "the task description can be set to `task-multitask`.\n",
    "The `*_meg.json` file SHOULD contain details on the *Tasks*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some manufacturers' data storage conventions use directories which contain data\n",
    "files of various nature: for example, CTF's `.ds` format, or BTi/4D's data directory.\n",
    "Yet other manufacturers split their files once they exceed a certain size\n",
    "limit.\n",
    "For example Neuromag/Elekta/Megin, which can produce several files\n",
    "for a single recording.\n",
    "Both `some_file.fif` and `some_file-1.fif` would belong to a single recording.\n",
    "In BIDS, the [`split`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#split) entity is RECOMMENDED to deal\n",
    "with split files.\n",
    "If there are multiple parts of a recording and the optional `scans.tsv` is provided,\n",
    "remember to list all files separately in `scans.tsv` and that the entries for the\n",
    "`acq_time` column in `scans.tsv` MUST all be identical, as described in\n",
    "[Scans file](../03-modality-agnostic-files.md#scans-file).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another manufacturer-specific detail pertains to the KIT/Yokogawa/Ricoh system,\n",
    "which saves the MEG sensor coil positions in a separate file with two possible filename extensions  (`.sqd`, `.mrk`).\n",
    "For these files, the `markers` suffix MUST be used.\n",
    "For example: `sub-01_task-nback_markers.sqd`\n",

    "for general information on how to deal with such manufacturer specifics and to see more examples.\n",

    "The [`proc-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#proc) entity is analogous to the\n",
    "[`rec-<label>`](../99-appendices/09-entities.md#rec) entity for MRI,\n",
    "and denotes a variant of a file that was a result of particular processing performed on the device.\n",
    "This is useful for files produced in particular by Elekta's MaxFilter\n",
    "(for example, sss, tsss, trans, quat, mc),\n",
    "which some installations impose to be run on raw data prior to analysis.\n",
    "Such processing steps are needed for example because of active shielding software corrections\n",
    "that have to be performed to before the MEG data can actually be exploited.\n",
