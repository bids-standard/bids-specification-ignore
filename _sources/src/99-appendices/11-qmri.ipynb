    "# Appendix XI: Quantitative MRI\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative MRI (qMRI) is a collection of methods aiming at generating parametric maps\n",
    "that can characterize underlying tissue properties.\n",
    "Unlike those of conventional MR images (for example, `T1w` or `T2w`),\n",
    "intensity values of quantitative maps are not represented in an arbitrary range.\n",
    "Instead, these maps are represented either in absolute physical units\n",
    "(for example, `seconds` for `T1map`),\n",
    "or within an application dependent range of arbitrary units\n",
    "(for example, myelin water fraction `MWFmap` in brain).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organization of qMRI data in BIDS\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike conventional MR images, quantitative maps are not immediate products of the image reconstruction step\n",
    "(from k-space data to structural images).\n",
    "Intensity values of qMRI maps are calculated by fitting a collection of parametrically\n",
    "linked images to a biophysical model or to an MRI signal representation.\n",
    "This processing is typically carried out in the image domain.\n",
    "There are two main ways to obtain a quantitative map:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Pre-generated qMRI maps: The qMRI maps are generated right after the reconstruction\n",
    "    of required input images and made available to the user at the scanner console.\n",
    "    The acquisition scenarios may include (a) vendor pipelines or (b) open-source pipelines\n",
    "    deployed at the scanner site.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Post-generated qMRI maps: The qMRI maps are generated from a collection of input\n",
    "    data after they are exported from the scanner site.\n",
    "    This type of processing is commonly carried out using an open-source software such as\n",
    "    [hMRI toolbox](https://github.com/hMRI-group/hMRI-toolbox),\n",
    "    [mrQ](https://github.com/mezera/mrQ),\n",
    "    [PyQMRI](https://github.com/IMTtugraz/PyQMRI),\n",
    "    [qmap](https://www.medphysics.wisc.edu/~samsonov/qmap/doc/qmap.html),\n",
    "    [qMRLab](https://github.com/qmrlab/qmrlab),\n",
    "    and [QUIT](https://github.com/spinicist/QUIT).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs are file collections\n",
    "\n",
    "The common concept of [entity-linked file collections](../02-common-principles.md#entity-linked-file-collections) enables the description of a qMRI\n",
    "application by creating logical groups of input files through `suffix` and certain entities\n",
    "representing acquisition parameters (`echo`, `flip`, `inv`, `mt`) or file parts (`part`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a qMRI file collection is intended for creating structural quantitative maps (for example, `T1map`),\n",
    "files belonging to that collection are stored in the `anat` subdirectory.\n",
    "Below is an example file collection for `MP2RAGE`:\n",
    "\n",

    "As these images do not convey substantial structural information,\n",

    "-   Some BIDS metadata field values are calculated based on the values of other metadata fields that are not listed as required fields.\n",
    "    These fields include: `NumberShots`.\n",
    "    The calculation of the values may depend on the type of the acquisition.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### `UNIT1` images\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the `UNIT1` image is provided as an output by the acquisition sequence, it is used\n",
    "as an input to offline calculation of a `T1map` using a dictionary lookup approach. However,\n",
    "`complex` data is needed for an accurate calculation of the `UNIT1` image, which is not commonly\n",

    "for quantifying a `T1map`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an additional `UNIT1` image is calculated offline, then the output is to be stored in the\n",
    "`derivatives` directory with necessary provenance information.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `NumberShots` metadata field\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the type of `NumberShots` field can be either a `number` or an `array of numbers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If a single `number` is provided, this should correspond to the number of `SlicesPerSlab` or `ReconMatrixPE`.\n",
    "    However, in this case, `SlicePartialFourier` or `PartialFourierPE` fraction is needed\n",
    "    to calculate the number of partitions `before` and `after` of the k-space center to calculate a T1 map.\n",

    "\n",
